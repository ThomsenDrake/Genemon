# Genemon

A procedurally generated Pokemon Blue clone where each new game features 151 completely unique Pokemon generated from scratch.

## 🎮 Concept

Unlike traditional Pokemon games with fixed rosters, Genemon creates a fresh experience every playthrough:
- **151 unique Pokemon** generated procedurally for each new game
- **Unique stats, types, and movesets** - no two playthroughs are the same
- **Procedural sprites and designs** - each Pokemon looks different
- **Classic Pokemon Blue gameplay** - familiar mechanics, infinite variety

## 🚧 Development Status

**This project is being autonomously developed by Claude Code in a sandboxed environment.**

Each iteration, Claude Code analyzes the codebase and makes incremental improvements:
- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs
- Improving code quality
- Enhancing documentation

All commits are made automatically as Claude works through the implementation.
