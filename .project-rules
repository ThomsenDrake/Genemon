# PROJECT RULES - READ FIRST

This file documents critical project rules that must be followed.

## READ-ONLY FILES (NEVER MODIFY)
- prompt.md - The project specification and requirements

## PROGRESS TRACKING
Use these files to document changes and progress across iterations:
- CHANGELOG.md - Log of all code changes, additions, deletions
- PROGRESS.md or DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - Notes on what was accomplished each iteration

## LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS
- Minimum 70% of codebase must be Python 3.x
- Core game logic, systems, and features MUST be Python
- Helper scripts (build, setup) may use other languages

## DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
- Iterative evolution of a single codebase
- Refactor, optimize, and prune as needed
- Never start from scratch - build on previous work
- Document all major changes in CHANGELOG.md
